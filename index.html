<h1>The Ext-algebra Page</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Ext-algebra page! Using links on this page, you may
<ul>
	<li>define a special biserial algebra by drawing its quiver and relations
	using a Java applet (<a href="qcad.html">
			<i><font color=red>q</font>ui<font color=red>v</font>erC<font color=red>A</font>D</I></A>)
	
  <li>use a <a href="extalgperl/extalg.cgi">web application</a> to compute the 
    basis of the Ext-algebra of your algebra using the method developed in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=IssueURL&_tockey=%23TOC%236838%231999%23997789997%23302154%23FLP%23Volume_221,_Issue_2,_Pages_385-734_(15_November_1999)&_auth=y&view=c&_acct=C000053443&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=1516330&md5=3c1202ff78e9a05447aa9dad0aff4035">

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>This software is still in its infancy so it may not be well-behaved
at all times. Some symptoms of bad behavior may include
<ul>
	<li>incorrect results
	<li>unexpected results
	<li>failure to return results (infinite loop)
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>In order to run the
<i><font color=red>q</font>ui<font color=red>v</font>erC<font color=red>A</font>D</i>
applet, you will need the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.3/plugin-install.html">Java 1.3 plug-in</a>,
which is available for download from Sun's Java site.  If the
plug-in is not installed, you will be prompted to download and install it when you try
to run the applet.

<p>The applet does not appear to work on Macs at the moment )-:

<h2>Notes on Ext-algebra computation</h2>
<p>
The
<i><font color=red>q</font>ui<font color=red>v</font>erC<font color=red>A</font>D</i>
applet does not yet check that the relations defined on the quiver satisfy the special
biserial conditions but the computational engine that calculates the Ext-algebra makes
some implicit assumptions about the input it receives. Therefore, if the quiver submitted
for computation is not special biserial, some implicit relations will be imposed on it to
make it special biserial. In particular, any two parallel paths will be assumed to be
equal. In a future version of 
<i><font color=red>q</font>ui<font color=red>v</font>erC<font color=red>A</font>D</i>
the special biserial conditions will be checked whenever an arrow is added to the quiver,
and whenever relations are deleted to ensure that the quiver always represents a special
biserial algebra.

<p>The Ext-algebra computational engine terminates non-zero cycles at length 62 to prevent
infinite loops.

<p>Basis elements which are cyclic (i.e., long exact sequence beginning and ending
with the same simple module) are not extended further by the program,
so the actual basis contains all products of these sequences. The products will not
be contained in the set of minimal generators anyway.

<p>Special biserial algebras of infinite representation type are identified by the
Ext-algebra engine by looking for <i>primitive V-sequences</i>, that is string modules
which can be joined arbitrarily many times with themselves to yield indecomposable
modules of arbitrary length. The algorithm for computing Ext-algebras does not apply to
the case of infinite representation type.

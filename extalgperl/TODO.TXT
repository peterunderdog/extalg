1. identify algebras of infinite representation type by checking for primitive V-sequences in 
   get_basis (see Skowronski-Waschbusch p. 176)...if primitive V-sequence is found, terminate
   and tell user

   e.g., ex/1.5

   1>4<3>2<1 is a primitive V-sequence

2. find a way to get minimal relations...find_equiv_paths already finds commutativity relations,
   but these sometimes need to be reduced...e.g., ex/1.3
 
   b_0 =~ b_7 b_5 b_4 
   b_0 =~ b_8 b_6 b_4 
   b_1 =~ b_5 b_4 
   b_2 =~ b_6 b_4 
   b_3 =~ b_7 b_5 
   b_3 =~ b_8 b_6 
	 
   b_7 b_5 b_4 =~ b_8 b_6 b_4 is trivial since b_7 b_5 =~ b_8 b_6 by the last two
   statements

   need to find zero relations...a path is a zero relation iff it is not equivalent to a 
   basis sequence
